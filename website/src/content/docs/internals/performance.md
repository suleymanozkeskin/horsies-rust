# Performance

Per-statement latency over a 24-hour window: workers and managed Postgres on
separate machines in the same region, entry-tier instance, ~2.5M statements
across the top 20 by execution count. The statements are the shared SQL
surface of the horsies schema — the Rust port transcribes the same
server-side functions and hot-path statements, so the per-statement costs
below are properties of the statements, not of the client runtime.

| Statement | Count / 24h | p50 | p99 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cap-serialization advisory lock | 902,184 | 0 ms | 0 ms |
| NOTIFY dispatch triggers | 260,248 | 0 ms | 0 ms |
| Claim function (`horsies_claim`) | 150,417 | 1 ms | 2 ms |
| Attempt-history retention delete | 37,478 | 0 ms | 1 ms |
| Heartbeat insert | 36,765 | 0 ms | 1 ms |
| Finalize fence update | 35,923 | 0 ms | 1 ms |
| Task enqueue insert | 31,412 | 1 ms | 2 ms |
| Requeue / unclaim update | 31,350 | 0 ms | 1 ms |

No statement in the top 20 by count exceeds a 2 ms p99.

## Where the runtime goes

The claim function is the most expensive statement on the instance at ~18%
of total DB runtime — by design. It is the entire claim critical section
(advisory lock, candidate selection, per-queue cap enforcement, claim
update) as one server-side statement, so the lock is held across a single
statement rather than across client round trips. The two statements that
reach 2 ms p99 are the two that do the most work per call: the claim
function and the enqueue insert. Everything around them is near-free.

## What the numbers measure

Server-side per-statement latency. End-to-end task latency adds network
round trips between your processes and the database, which scale with
distance — co-locating workers with Postgres removes them entirely.

The table is a reference shape, not a ceiling: the instance is entry-tier,
and per-statement latency stays flat as load grows until the instance
saturates. Headroom scales with the instance tier.

Results scale with the Postgres instance: a PlanetScale Postgres and a
Heroku Postgres will not perform the same, and a transaction-pooled
connection path taxes every round trip. Deployment guidance:
